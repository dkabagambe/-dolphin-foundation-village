      <h2>Volunteer in Africa</h2>
      <div class="volunteer_info">
        <p>
          Are you looking for a way to make a difference in the world, gain new
          experiences and training, see new career possibilities, do something
          different, get away from the normal grind, be adventurous, share your
          faith, or have you always had a secret desire to see Africa? We can
          help you achieve any and all of those goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dolphin Foundation is located in the beautiful, East African city of
          Kampala, Uganda. Dolphin Foundation Uganda, Inc., is a registered NGO
          in Uganda. We care for abandoned, orphaned and at risk babies. Over
          three hundred babies have found love and life at the Dolphin baby
          home. We need all kinds of talents, from film making, painting,
          teaching, building, physical therapy and nursing to just holding and
          cuddling babies who need lots love.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can volunteer for up to one month. A one to two week stay is
          recommended. After all, this is Africa and it will require a lot of
          adjustment on your part. (To volunteer for longer than one month will
          require evaluation and approval from the Dolphin Foundation
          directors.)
        </p>
        <p>
          As a volunteer Dolphin Foundation becomes your sponsor to stay in the
          country and Dolphin is responsible for you and your activities while
          in Uganda. Volunteers may only stay in our housing on campus. Only
          volunteers living on campus in our volunteer program may volunteer at
          Dolphin Foundation. We have a large volunteer program and day visitors
          are not allowed to volunteer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your volunteer housing payments must state they are for your housing.
          All checks or donations must state your name and “Housing Payment.” If
          not we might use it for formula!!
        </p>
        <p>
          All volunteers over the age of 18 are required to purchase a volunteer
          visa, regardless of their length of stay, unless you have been
          otherwise instructed by the volunteer coordinator. The volunteer Visa
          will cost $200 to $250, depending on where you are coming from. After
          you have applied to volunteer at Dolphin Foundation and have received
          permission from our volunteer coordinator to plan your trip and come,
          you will receive additional instructions about getting your volunteer
          visa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Volunteers must be at least 18 years of age or be accompanied by a
          parent or guardian.

          for breakfast, and stew, hamburgers and frys, spaghetti, etc. for
          dinner. The morning chai and mid-day meal are provided while on duty
          at Dolphin, but snacks and eating out are on your own. Most volunteers
          spend about $150 to $200 for extra food and eating out per month.
          Remember it is Africa and many of our meals at Dolphin are African
          style, rice and beans, ugali and vegetables and luscious fruit. There
          are many good restaurants in Kampala.

          Driver and transportation is provided while on duty at Dolphin. Some
