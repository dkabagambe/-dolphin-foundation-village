                  care of him the first two months of his life. She then started
                  getting depressed and the family said was not acting like
                  herself. She then got pneumonia and sadly passed away.

                  NEW baby! Little Anna is only 1 week old. She came to us with
                  a tragic story. Her mother had an accident in the kitchen when
                  the propane stove exploded! She died later at the hospital
                  from the burns, then the doctors quickly opened her up and got
                  baby Anna out in time to save her life. The extended family
                  can't care for Anna right now, so we will love and care for
                  her. Later we will see how we can get her into a permanent
                  loving home. Please donate this month to Dolphin foundation ,
                  your monthly support is what enables us to care for babies
